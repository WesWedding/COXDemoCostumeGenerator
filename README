Feel free to fix my terrible code!

This project was mostly implemented as part of a final project for the 
Functional Languages class at PSU.  It still needs some work and this
seems like something only I really have any interest in so I will
probably try to fix the things that are broken myself sometime in the
near future.

This is a Haskell implementation, and was run in Hugs.  It should run
fine in other Haskell interpereters or GHC, I imagine.
